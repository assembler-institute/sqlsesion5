    "\n",
    "Partitioning tables in MySQL allows us to rotate the information in our tables into different partitions, making queries faster and reclaiming disk space when deleting records. The most common use of partitioning is by date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning is performed using a partitioning key, which determines in which of the existing partitions in the table the data to be inserted will reside. Oracle also allows partitioning of indexes and tables organised by indexes. Each partition can also have its own storage properties. The partitioned tables appear in the system as a single table, with the system automatically managing read and write to each partition (except for the System partition introduced in version 11g). The definition of the partitions is indicated in the table creation sentence, with the appropriate syntax for each of the types.\n",
    "- Partitioning Range: the partitioning key is determined by a range of values, which determines the partition where a value will be stored.\n",
    "- Partitioning Hash: the partitioning key is a hash function, applied on a column, which aims to make an equal distribution of the records over the different partitions. It is useful for partitioning tables where there are no clear partitioning criteria, but where better performance is desired.\n",
    "- Partitioning List: The partitioning key is a list of values, which determines each of the partitions.\n",
    "- Composite Partitioning: the previous partitions were of the simple type (single or one-level), because we use a single partitioning method on one or more columns. Oracle allows us to use composite partitioning methods, using a first partitioning of a given type, and then for each partition, perform a second level of partitioning using another method. The combinations are as follows (they have been extended as versions have progressed): range-hash, range-list, range-range, list-range, list-list, list-hash and hash-hash (introduced in version 11g).\n",
    "- Partitioning Interval: type of partitioning also introduced in version 11g. Instead of indicating the ranges of values that will determine how the partitioning is performed, the system will automatically create partitions when a new record is inserted into the b.d. The techniques of this type available are Interval, Interval List, Interval Range and Interval Hash (so Interval partitioning is complementary to the partitioning techniques seen above).\n",
    "- System Partitioning: the partitioned table is defined by specifying the desired partitions, but no partitioning key is specified. In this type of partitioning, the partitioning management is delegated to the applications that use the database (for example, in the sql insertion sentences we must indicate in which partition we insert the data)."
